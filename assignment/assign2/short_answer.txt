Q1. It is your choice to use either an ordered or unordered set. In a few sentences, what are some of the tradeoffs between the two? Additionally, please give an example (that has not been shown in lecture) of a valid hash function that could be used to hash student names for an unordered set.
A1. unordered_set has no other, under the hood, it was implemented by a hash table, the time of searching in unordered_set is O(1).
set has other that we can define it, under the hood, it was implemented by a tree, the time of searching in set is O(logn).

Q2. Note that we are saving pointers to names in the queue, not names themselves. Why might this be desired in this problem? What happens if the original set where the names are stored goes out of scope and the pointers are referenced?
A2.
